📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction (1–5 Days)

📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based Bitcoin price prediction application developed as part of my B.Sc Data Science final year academic project.

The application predicts Bitcoin prices for the next 1 to 5 days using historical market data and machine learning concepts. The main goal of this project is to understand the end-to-end workflow of a price prediction system — from data handling to model prediction and web deployment.

This project is learning-oriented and focuses on conceptual understanding and implementation, not real-world trading accuracy.

🎯 Objectives

Understand how time-series price prediction works

Learn how machine learning models integrate with web applications

Build a simple Flask-based web app

Gain exposure to data preprocessing and prediction flow

Practice end-to-end project deployment structure

🚀 Features

Predicts Bitcoin prices for 1–5 future days

Uses historical Bitcoin price data

Simple and user-friendly web interface

Flask-based backend application

Clear display of predicted results

🧠 How the Project Works (High-Level Flow)

User Input

User selects the number of days (1–5) for prediction

Data Handling

Historical Bitcoin price data is processed

Data is prepared for prediction (cleaning, formatting)

Prediction Logic

Machine learning concepts are applied to forecast prices

Prediction is generated for the selected future days

Result Display

Predicted prices are shown on the web interface
