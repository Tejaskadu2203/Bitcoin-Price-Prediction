📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction (1–5 Days)

📌 Project Overview 
This project is a web-based Bitcoin price prediction application developed as part of my B.Sc Data Science final year academic project.

The application predicts Bitcoin prices for the next 1 to 5 days using historical market data and machine learning concepts. The main goal of this project is to understand the end-to-end workflow of a price prediction system — from data handling to model prediction and web deployment.

🎯 Objectives

Understand how time-series price prediction works

Learn how machine learning models integrate with web applications

Build a simple Flask-based web app

Gain exposure to data preprocessing and prediction flow

Practice end-to-end project deployment structure

🚀 Features 

Predicts Bitcoin prices for 1–5 future days

Uses historical Bitcoin price data

Simple and user-friendly web interface

Flask-based backend application

Clear display of predicted results

🧠 How the Project Works (High-Level Flow)

User Input

User selects the number of days (1–5) for prediction

Data Handling

Historical Bitcoin price data is processed

Data is prepared for prediction (cleaning, formatting)

📖 Prediction Logic

Machine learning concepts are applied to forecast prices

Prediction is generated for the selected future days

Result Display

Predicted prices are shown on the web interface
